To make python programs you only need Python and a text editor. For my code, I use Vistual Studio Code. 

COMMENTS. Comments let programmers explain what they are doing. Comments are essential to beginners. Use comments often.
Python comments start with # 
# This is an example of a python comment.
# 1 + 1 = 2
# I hope this code works

Are all comments in Python. Get used to using them.
