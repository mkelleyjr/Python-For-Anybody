To make python programs you only need Python and a text editor. For my code, I use Vistual Studio Code. 

COMMENTS. Comments let programmers explain what they are doing. Comments are essential to beginners. Use comments often.
Python comments start with # 
# This is an example of a python comment.
# 1 + 1 = 2
# I hope this code works

Comments can also be used on code to block it from running. Use a comment on a line of code to test a program that is having issues.
If it works fine with the line of code commented out, you know that line is causing the issue. Some code can be commented out if it
is going to be used in the future or only certain times a program is ran. 

Get used to using comments!
