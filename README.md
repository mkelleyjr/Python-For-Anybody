# Python-For-Anybody
Educational code and materials for teachers, students, and anybody interested. Featuring the Python programming language. Python is a free language that runs on many systems. It is easy to install and coding examples can be short and concise. If you would like to help with this repo, please let me know! 

Note: This repo is in part a project of my own to help me better learn the Python langauge.
